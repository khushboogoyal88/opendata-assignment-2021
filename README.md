# Assignment: Open Data TEST

Visual represntation of data reveived from 4 different sensors during the day, along with past data.

The application is currently hosted at `https://opendata-assignment.herokuapp.com/`

## Tech Stack Used

I have used MERN stack to complete this assignment. And styling is done with custom css for each component. ReactJS chart liobrary is used for visula reprentation of data.

URl used for pulling the data:`https://opendata.hopefully.works/api/events`. Bearer token is used to fetch the data.

To access the data you need to `/api/signup` to our API. The signup is easy; you **POST** your email and a password **as JSON** in the request body into our signup endpoint `https://opendata.hopefully.works/api/signup`. As a return message you will receive an **accessToken**, which you will have to use for the subsequent requests.
